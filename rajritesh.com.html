		<div>A need was recognized to design a revoutionary beach rescue vehicle that can navigate on a variety of surfaces like level land, marshes, water, ice. Subsequently, in references to that a personal mobility vehicle (PMV) was designed using the available concept of hovercraft that subsidizes use of time and manual labour. The two main principles of lift and propulsion were used which makes it travel irrespective of wind and water current.The hovercraft results in zero friction between the vehicle and surface which in turn causes no damage to marine life. </div>
